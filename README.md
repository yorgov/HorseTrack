# HorseTrack
The latest executable can be found in the binaries folder

This application allows you to track the respawn time of wild horses for different spots in the game Black Desert Online 

This was created because as a self respecting horse trainer I needed to be able to switch channels and go around different spots in order to progress my Training skill.

This tool helps me keep track of the time I have left on a certain spot on a certain channel

I hope it helps you as well.
